Find all states that are possible for this input
    Generating all possible (valid and invalid) states
    39366 possible (valid and invalid) states found
    Select only the valid states. For every state:
        Check if the VCs are satisfied
        Check if the influences are satisfied
        Check if the proportionalities are satisfied
        Check if the algorithm constraints are satisfied
    24 possible valid states found
Find the edges of the graph
    Find all exogenous quantities:['inflow']
    Find all derivatives that can be inferred from influences and proportionalities: ['volume', 'pressure', 'outflow', 'height']
    Based on these find all the derivatives that cannot change from influences and proportionalities: []
    Assume these non-changable derivatives to be random exogenous
    For every state (example values are for first state only):
        Example state: volume zero 0 pressure zero 0 outflow zero 0 inflow zero 0 height zero 0 
        Get the quantities that can change in the next step: ['volume', 'pressure', 'outflow', 'inflow', 'height']
        If there are no instantaneous changes: get a list of valid states with changes in every possible combination of changable quantities
        If there are instantaneous changes - get one state with all of them applied
            Example: Non-instantaneous transition, possible changed quantities: 
                volume zero 0 pressure zero 0 outflow zero 0 inflow zero 0 height zero 0 
        For all states with changed quantities:
            In case of instant change - find the next state with least amount of derivative changes
            Otherwise: find all possible children without restrictions
                Filter the possible matching children from all valid states:
                    Filter out all the states not matching the new quantities
                    Filter out all the states with different derivatives defined as non-changable
                    Filter out all the states which doesn't match an exogenous change
                    Filter out all the states that have incontinuous gradients
            Connect the state with the found new states
                Example: 1 found child(ren): 
                    volume zero 0 pressure zero 0 outflow zero 0 inflow zero + height zero 0
