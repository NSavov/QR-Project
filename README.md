This project is for the course Knowledge Representation on the UvA.

- paramaterisation of inflow and volume
- we use VCs to infer further values
- we infer, using the dependencies (I+, I-), the derivatives and construct all childnodes
- proportionalities are used to get more information about the derivatives
- these left overs are the states (actual children of parent)
